# JavaScript_Apps

Please note that these applications were initially written in Python by another programmer.
I have taken that Python code and converted it into JavaScript code as a personal exercise. 
That being said, please enjoy and or test the JavaScript code in Node.js, and feel free to make any suggestions as to how it can be improved.

Thank you!
