# JavaScript_Apps

Please note that these applications were initially written in Python by another programmer.
Therefore these are not my ideas. 
Rather, I have converted the Python code into Javascript code as a personal exercise.
That being said, please enjoy the code and feel free to make any suggestions as to how it can be improved.

Thank you!
